**Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

Customer churn prediction is to measure why customers are leaving a business. In this Project, we will looking at customer churn in telecom business. We will build a deep learning model to predict the churn and use precision,recall, f1-score to measure performance of our model. We will then handle imbalance in data using various techniques and improve f1-score.

The flow of the project is as below:
>Data Exploration

>Data Visualization

>Variable Encoding

>Model Building

>Evaluating Model Performance

>Mitigating Skewdness of Data
